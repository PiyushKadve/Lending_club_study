# Lending-Club-Case-Study

You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- This project is based on financial lending company scenario.

## Conclusions
- About 14% of loan are having status as defaulters.
- Low grade loans have high tendency to default. Grading system is working as expected.
- It is safe to say lower age leads to higher changes of someone availing loan.
- We see loans are given to people irrespective of checking their annual income, which can lead to increase in number of defaulters. 
Extra attention must to given in this aspect
